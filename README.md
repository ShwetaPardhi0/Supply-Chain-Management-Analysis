# Supply-Chain-Management-Analysis Dashboard (Power BI) 📊

## 🎯 Problem Statement

The company is facing inconsistent sales and profit performance across different years, regions, product types, and customer segments. Sales in 2023 dropped significantly, and there is no clear visibility on which areas, customer groups, or product lines are driving or dragging performance. These gaps make it difficult to take strategic actions.
